```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Getting data
```{r readData}
insol_raw <- read_csv(
  "../raw_data/insolvency_filings_de_julaug2020.csv",
  col_types = cols()
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
